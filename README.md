# Connect4 game using Python with the Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms

## This code implements a Connect 4 game using the Pygame library in Python

#### The user first gets to choose two things; the algorithm and the difficulty, then the game starts with the computer making the first move based on the previous user choices. After the computer's move, the game waits for the user to click on a position on the screen to place their game piece. Once the user makes their move, a 1.5 timer is set before the computer plays again, and this process continues until the game is over. The game checks for a win or a draw after each move and displays the appropriate message on the screen, depending on whoever won.

#### A descriptive message is always displayed at the top of the screen that's either "Waiting for user" or "Waiting for computer". Players take turns placing their game pieces on the board, aiming to connect four of their pieces either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before their opponent does.
